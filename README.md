# Wikary: A Dataset of N-ary Wikipedia Tables Matched to Qualified Wikidata Statements

We introduce a dataset of almost 32.000 tables from 3 Wikipedia language versions which have been matched to Wikidata statements with qualifiers at 98.4% precision.
The tables express a diverse set of n-ary relations which constitute a new target for semantic table interpretation research.
